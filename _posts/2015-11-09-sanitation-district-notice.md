title: Notice from Sanitation District &#35;1
---

Sanitation has begun a new recycling program, and also altered our regular pickup schedule.
Notices were hung on doorknobs throughout Mill Brook, 
but in the event you misplaced or did not receive yours, the information can be found
[here](http://millbrookcivic.com/pdf/sanitation-district-1-flyer.pdf). 
In addition, their website has an interactive feature that allows you to enter a street name 
(example: Woodland, Cloverfield, Southgate) and you are shown a calendar marked with your pickup dates. 
Go to [http://sanitarydistrict1.com/](http://sanitarydistrict1.com/) and click on What Day is My Pickup? If you no longer 
have a yellow recycling receptacle, call 516-239-5600 to request one. 
For specific issues with Sanitation, call George Pappas at (516) 996-0057.
