Mill Brook's environmental expert, Tricia Vanderbeck, led a group of South High School
students in tending our community gardens.
The civic association provided the supplies, but Trish and her hard-working volunteers made it happen.
Our next garden event will be in the fall. Please come out and help us keep our community beautiful.
Watch this website for the November date.
