description: Police Commissioner Forms New Community Council
---

Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder officially kicked into gear
his Community Council, a police task force with a subdivision in each
of the county’s 19 legislative districts.

Ryder and County Executive Laura Curran worked with the county’s 19 legislators
to select residents who “have a finger on the pulse of their communities,”
Curran said. On April 9 at the Cradle of Aviation Museum, a room full
of residents were sworn into their positions.

The members of the community council have agreed to volunteer their time
to address the specific issues plaguing their community. They will be meeting
with county police and their legislator, periodically, to develop plans
of action and discuss what can be done to curb local crime. Eventually,
an executive community council will be chosen to oversee the other 19 groups.

“When you speak to people from different communities, that’s when you start
to understand each other's cultures, and understand what the needs are
for each community,” Ryder said. “And that’s what we intend to do with
this community council.”

The representative from Mill Brook is Natalie Cange.
