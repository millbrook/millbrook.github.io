## Scholarship Recipient Kristin Luyun

Every year, the civic association awards a $500 scholarship to a Mill Brook
senior at SHS based on a submitted essay and other accomplishments. At the
award ceremony on June 9th, board member Yadlynd Cherubin-Eide presented the
scholarship to this year’s recipient, Kristin Luyun. Congratulations to
Kristin on receiving this honor, and good luck to all the graduating seniors of
2021.
