title: Welcome to Our New and Improved Website
---

In an effort to make information available to the residents of our
community, we have updated the format and appearance of our site.
It is the civic associationâ€™s hope that you will utilize these pages to not
only stay current with local news and events, but to contribute your
own ideas and suggestions, both for the site and our neighborhood.

Please check in often for new content and take a moment to explore
the links provided. Your input and comments are invaluable and will
serve to further unite the members of our community in maintaining
Mill Brook as a harmonious place to live, work and play.

In order to reach everyone in our community via our emailed
bulletins, we ask that you please send us your email address. Just
email it to [general@millbrookcivic.com](mailto:general@millbrookcivic.com).

Thank you as always for your support and participation. You can
send us a message via the [Contact Us]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link contact-us.html %})
or by email at [general@millbrookcivic.com](mailto:general@millbrookcivic.com).

We look forward to hearing from you, and seeing you at our spring
and fall general meetings.

*With best wishes from your volunteer civic association board.*<br/>
*Join us in serving our community!*
