title: Seeking New Board Members
---

The Mill Brook Civic Association is looking for community residents to add to our board.
If you have two hours a month to share and enjoy working on a team,
please consider joining us at one of our monthly board meetings to see what we do.
You can do it too.
If you enjoy living in Mill Brook, ask yourself why.
Is it because there’s a real feeling of neighborhood?
Is it because there’s a dedicated association that plans concerts, supports picnics,
and organizes beautification projects?
A group that holds meetings to keep the community informed, liaisons between police,
local government, and the mall that borders us?
If you want to be a part of the bigger picture,
please [Contact Us]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link contact-us.html %}) and address message to Membership Committee.
We’re your neighbors and we’d love to hear from you. Even better, see you.
