All contributions including typo fixes, feature requests, ideas, design tweaks, etc. are welcome. 
We welcome all input, from sharing your own implementations of code to general thoughts and ideas. Just open a new issue in GitHub!

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are always welcome! If Jekyll can do it and if the theme's design would work well with it, then we can add it.
Please submit the changes via GitHub pull requests.
[Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) explains how to do that.
